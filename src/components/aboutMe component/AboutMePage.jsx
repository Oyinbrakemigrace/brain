          that not only look great but achieve real outcomes. <br /> <br />
          With proficiency in no-code tools like Framer, I quickly prototype and iterate, ensuring efficient, 
          high-quality project delivery. I thrive in collaborative environments, bringing strategic thinking, 
          creative problem-solving, and a commitment to excellence to every project. <br /><br />
