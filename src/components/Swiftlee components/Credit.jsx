                I had the privilege of collaborating with an incredible team throughout the development of 
                Swiftlee. This case study would not be complete without recognizing the contributions of 
                every member of the Swiftlee Development Team. Their dedication, creativity, 
                and teamwork were instrumental in bringing this project to fruition, and I am grateful 
                for the opportunity to have worked alongside such talented individuals.
